    "At the beginning we put four tasks in the loop. One of them spits out what is happening every two seconds. Other tasks at first has `status`: `ONGOING`, which means they have been started but since they hit `await` our program doesn't have to focus here, it can move to next task (or in other scenario it can redraw GUI so our application is not frozen because we wait for database response). Loop also does remember that every awaitable task at some point will get the response and will be ready to continue, so it revisits them to see if that is the case. After four seconds we can see that task that waited 3 seconds has already been revisited and executed (its status has changed). In real-life scenario we wouldn't know how long it will take but event loop will take care of it anyways. At some point in time every task has ended and we stop reading. The loop is still running but there is no task to execute. We can also inspect results from tasks but they ofcourse don't have to return anything."
